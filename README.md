# Ham Club - A New YSWS from Hack Club
Ham Club is a program for teens in the US running from April 29th to May 31st, allowing youth to get their ham radio license and then receive a free ham radio!

# You Ship, We Ship

At Hack Club we're re-imagining a new type of public education for technology. We believe people learn best by creating things they care about and sharing them with others. We build open source creative tools with young people all around the world. These tools are gateways to new subjects in technology like [embedded systems](https://sprig.hackclub.com), [circuits](https://onboard.hackclub.com) or digital fabrication robotics. When teenagers build things with our tools we send them more creative materials for free. 

Our goal is to build a new type of library online that offers learners not just media to consume but tools to create. And it is free and open source to all. We're just getting started...
